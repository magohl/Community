# TalkToMeAPI - Text-to-speech Azure API App

[Link to GitHub](https://github.com/magohl/TalkToMeAPI)

This is a simple proof-of-concept of a custom Azure API App to be used in a Azure Logic App.

[![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://azuredeploy.net/?repository=https://github.com/magohl/TalkToMeAPI)

There are two main parts. First the API that hosts a SignalR hub and the second one is the UI that connects one (or more) browser as the API App "Loudspeaker". As an Azure API App is just a 'normal' Web App it can host both and no other deployment is needed.

- **WebAPI**
  - SignalR Hub
- **Client UI**
  - [mespeak.js](http://www.masswerk.at/mespeak)
  - SignalR client

My first sample scenario used to try the API Appwas a Logic App getting weather data from api.openweathermap.com that the TalkToMe API then read out.

## How to use
1. Deploy Azure API App
2. Create and deploy a Logic App where TalkToMe is used as an 'action'

3. Connect one or more browsers to the API by browsing the API root URL

4. Run the Logic App

##Test using REST
If you just want to try the API App out and verify that it works you can just post

| REST param  | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| URL     | http://{your-apiapp-url}/api/TalkToMe |
| Method  | HTTP POST  |
| Content-Type  | application/json  |
| Body     | { "TextToRead" : "Nice weather today" } |
